Run the following command to generate certificates configured in localhost-cert.config file

openssl req -config ./localhost-cert.config -newkey rsa -x509 -days 3650 -out ./localhost.crt -keyout ./localhost.key

When running the above command if prompted for passwords then just press enter i.e. use blank passwords.


Convert the crt file to p12 format for use with Java. Note the export password requested was kept blank
openssl pkcs12 -export -out ./localhost.p12 -inkey ./localhost.key -in ./localhost.crt

When converting you will have to provide a password. Make a note of it as it will be needed for configuring java apps
export password used alligator*001
